Disclaimer: 
We have finished the functionality for this deliverable and also have the front and back end hosted. Unfortunately, our subscription to myasp.net provided by the Sheridan during our previous .net course has just recently ended. This is the only way we were taught to host .net projects and their backend. Myasp.net would automatically connect the frontend to the backend, but our new hosting which we had to use does not connect them automatically. This means the functionality only works locally currently as we have been unable to figure out connecting the front and backends without myasp.net and are still working on it.
